            <p className="text-2xl text-justify">
            SAPL, a publicly listed company, is the leading off-dock in the country’s private sector with around 22.50% shares in handling containerized exports and 10.50% of the import volume. Besides, SAPL has also established the first-ever Inland Water Terminal facility in Bangladesh’s private sector named “Muktarpur Terminal” on the bank of the Dhaleswari river in Muktarpur under Munshiganj district providing off-dock services and economical cargo transportation, easing the pressure on the already overburdened Dhaka-Chattogram highway. A subsidiary of SAPL has taken over the management of three river terminals in Kolkata and Patna as the first Bangladeshi company as well as the first Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI).
