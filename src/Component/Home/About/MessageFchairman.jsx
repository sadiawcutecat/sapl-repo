                    <p className="text-justify my-4">It is my privilege and honour to welcome you, the owners of Summit Alliance Port Limited (SAPL) to the 15th Annual General Meeting. Your Company is the pioneer in the Inland Container Depot (ICD), Container Freight Station (CFS) and River Terminal sectors in Bangladesh and continues to be the largest and most important contributor in the industry.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-justify my-4">
                    2018–19 was a truly historic year for your Company as handover of the Kolkata Garden Reach Terminal took place on 30th October 2018 and in just 8 months we have handled over 560,000 MT of cargo, thereby exceeding the 1st Year target set by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) by over 60%. Despite the challenges of working in a new environment SAPL’s Management has quickly implemented the processes and expertise gained from over 25 years of operating Off-Docks and Ports in order to gain the confidence and trust of the new Indian clients.
                    </p>
